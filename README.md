Interested in building scalable systems, contributing to open source, and working at the intersection of mathematics and technology.

I enjoy designing systems from first principles — whether it's backend architectures, signal processing pipelines, or learning-based models grounded in structure.

### Focus Areas 
- Backend Engineering (APIs, system design, databases)  
- C++ and performance-oriented programming  
- Machine Learning with structural bias    
- Open-source contribution  
- Systems thinking over surface-level abstraction   

### Technical Stack

#### Languages  
C++ • C • Python  

#### Backend & Databases  
Node.js (learning / building)  
MongoDB • MySQL  
REST APIs • Database schema design  

#### Machine Learning & Scientific Computing  
PyTorch • NumPy • Matplotlib  
CNNs • Signal modeling • Regression systems  

#### Core CS Foundations  
Data Structures & Algorithms   
Database Management Systems  
Operating Systems (coursework)   

### Selected Projects  
#### 1. Neural Adaptive Spectral Estimator
Comparative study between FFT-based frequency estimation and a 1D CNN trained on raw noisy signals.
Explores inductive bias in neural architectures and structured spectral modeling.

### Philosophy  
I prefer systems that are explainable, scalable, and grounded in solid fundamentals.
If something works, I want to understand why.
